# Emotion Recognition Using AI and CNNs

## **Overview**  
This project leverages Artificial Intelligence (AI), specifically Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), to recognize and analyze human emotions through facial expressions. By incorporating advanced AI techniques like transfer learning and data augmentation, the model achieves high accuracy, providing significant insights into emotion detection technology.  

## **Features**  
- Detects emotions using facial expression analysis.  
- Utilizes CNNs for feature extraction and classification.  
- Incorporates transfer learning and data augmentation for improved model performance.  
- Supports applications in sentiment analysis, emotion-aware systems, and educational technology.

## **Dataset**  
The project utilizes dataset with a wide variety of keywords, collected from two main directories available online on kaggle: training set ('image/train') and test set ('image/test') This dataset included a wide range of human emotions issue, such as ‘angry’, ‘disgusted’, ‘scared’, ‘excited’, ‘neutral’, ‘sad’, and ‘surprised’ served as the original items for our emotion recognition experiments.
